Aude Billard is Professor of Micro and Mechanical
Engineering, and the head of the LASA Laboratory at the
School of Engineering at the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology in Lausanne. She received an M.Sc. in Physics
from EPFL (1995), an M.Sc. in Knowledge-based Systems
(1996) and a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence (1998) from the
University of Edinburgh. She was the recipient of the Intel
Corporation Teaching award, the Swiss National Science
Foundation career award in 2002, the Outstanding Young
Person in Science and Innovation from the Swiss Chamber
of Commerce and the IEEE-RAS Best Reviewer award in
2012. Aude Billard served as an elected member of the Administrative Committee
of the IEEE Robotics and Automation society (RAS) for two terms (2006–2008 and
2009–2011) and is the chair of the IEEE-RAS Technical Committee on Humanoid
Robotics. Her research interests focus on machine learning tools to support robot
learning through human guidance. This extends also to research on complementary
topics, including machine vision and its use in human–robot interaction and
computational neuroscience to develop models of motor learning in humans.
